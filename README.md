# Vehicle Sales Dashboard.

This is a personal project that focuses on data analysis and the success metric is the creation of a fully functional, dynamic data dashboard using different python libraries.

## The dataset

I am using a dataset that is freely available on Kaggle.com. Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data) to open the dataset on Kaggle. The data set is a good one with most of the data being already present. There are many missing values and around 15% of the rows had some missing values, but the data can be easily imputed using a free api. Click [here](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/) to checkout the API.

Command to create the virtual environment: `python -m venv DAenv && source venv_name/bin/activate`
